# Tic-Tac-Toe Implementation Plan

## 1. Create HTML Structure
- Set up DOCTYPE, html, head, and body tags
- Add meta charset and viewport for responsive design
- Create main game container div
- Add message display area for game status
- Create board container (will hold 9 squares)
- Add hidden "Play Again" button

## 2. Build CSS Grid System
- Style game container for centering
- Implement CSS Grid for 3x3 board layout
- Set equal square dimensions with aspect ratio
- Add grid border styling (#333333)
- Create hover effects for empty squares

## 3. Style Game Elements
- Apply color scheme (cyan X, pink O, dark gray text)
- Set Arial font family across all elements
- Style game pieces with large, bold fonts
- Design Play Again button styling
- Add responsive breakpoints for mobile/tablet/desktop

## 4. Initialize Game State
- Create gameState object with board array, currentPlayer, gameActive, winner
- Set up board as Array(9).fill(null) for 9 squares
- Initialize currentPlayer as 'X' (X always starts)
- Set gameActive to true and winner to null

## 5. Create Board Rendering
- Generate 9 clickable div squares
- Add click event listeners to each square
- Map array indices to grid positions (0-8)
- Display X/O pieces based on board state
- Update square content when moves are made

## 6. Implement Move Logic
- Create makeMove(index) function
- Validate moves (check if square is empty and game active)
- Update board array with current player's piece
- Call checkWinner() after each move
- Switch to next player if game continues

## 7. Build Win Detection
- Create checkWinner() function
- Define winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals)
- Check all win conditions against current board state
- Set winner and gameActive status when match found
- Return true if winner found, false otherwise

## 8. Add Draw Detection
- Create checkDraw() function
- Check if board is full (no null values) and no winner
- Set winner to 'draw' and gameActive to false
- Return boolean for draw state

## 9. Create Display Updates
- Build showMessage(text) function for status display
- Show current player's turn during gameplay
- Display win message: "[Player] Wins!"
- Display draw message: "It's a Draw!"
- Show/hide Play Again button based on game state

## 10. Implement Game Reset
- Create resetGame() function
- Reset gameState to initial values
- Clear all squares on the board
- Reset message display to show X's turn
- Hide Play Again button
- Restart game flow

## 11. Add Event Handling
- Attach click listeners to dynamically created squares
- Add Play Again button click handler
- Prevent text selection on game pieces
- Handle invalid move attempts gracefully

## 12. Test and Refine
- Verify all win conditions work correctly
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- Ensure draw detection functions properly
- Validate game reset functionality
- Check cross-browser compatibility
