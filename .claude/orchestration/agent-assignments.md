## Conflict Prevention Rules

1. **File Ownership**: Each agent owns exactly one file - no sharing
2. **Read-Only Components**: Agents read but never modify source components
3. **Independent Creation**: All stories are new files - no edits to existing
4. **Pattern Consistency**: All agents follow the story-structure.md contract
5. **No Cross-Dependencies**: Wave 1-2 agents work completely independently
6. **Sequential Validation**: Wave 4 only begins after all stories are complete

## Communication Protocol

Each agent must:
1. Create their assigned file in the correct location
2. Follow the integration contract specifications exactly
3. Not modify any files outside their territory
4. Complete their work independently of other agents
5. Produce self-contained, fully functional stories

## Resource Allocation

- **Wave 1**: 3 agents, 10 minutes (max parallelism for core components)
- **Wave 2**: 2 agents, 10 minutes (complex components with dependencies)
- **Wave 3**: 2 agents, 10 minutes (custom components building on Wave 1)
- **Wave 4**: 1 agent, 5 minutes (validation only, no creation)
