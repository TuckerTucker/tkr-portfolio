# Post-Launch Fixes & Improvements

## Issue Resolution: ThemeProvider Context Errors

### Problem Identified
After successful orchestration deployment, Storybook console showed ThemeProvider context errors:
```
Error: useTheme must be used within a ThemeProvider
```

### Root Cause Analysis
- HTML Slides story components (TechStack, slide-wrapper) use `useTheme()` hook
- Original HtmlSlides.stories.jsx did not provide ThemeProvider context
- New ThemeToggle.stories.jsx had proper ThemeProvider wrapping
- Conflict occurred when stories requiring theme context ran without provider

### Solution Implemented ✅
**File**: `stories/content/HtmlSlides.stories.jsx`

**Changes Made**:
1. Added ThemeProvider import: `import { ThemeProvider } from '../../src/hooks/useTheme';`
2. Added decorator to provide theme context for all HTML slide stories:
```javascript
decorators: [
  (Story) => (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Story />
    </ThemeProvider>
  ),
],
```

### Validation Results
- ✅ Storybook build now completes without errors
- ✅ All stories render successfully
- ✅ ThemeProvider context errors resolved
- ✅ Both new and existing stories work correctly

### Impact Assessment
- **Zero Breaking Changes** - No story functionality affected
- **Improved Reliability** - All theme-dependent components now have proper context
- **Enhanced Developer Experience** - No more console errors during development
- **Consistent Pattern** - Both new and existing stories follow same ThemeProvider pattern

### Quality Assurance
- Build time: ~10 seconds (optimal)
- All 16 story files functional
- Console errors eliminated
- Development server starts cleanly on port 42006
