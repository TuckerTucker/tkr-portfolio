Yes, GitHub Pages can host React applications. GitHub Pages is a service that allows you to publish static websites directly from your GitHub repository[1]. To deploy a React app to GitHub Pages, you need to follow these steps:
1. Install the gh-pages package as a dev dependency:
2. Add a homepage property to your package.json file:
3. Add deploy scripts to your package.json:
4. Build and deploy your application:
This command will create an optimized build of your React app and push it to a gh-pages branch in your GitHub repository[3]. GitHub Pages will then serve your application from this branch.
If your React app uses React Router for navigation, you'll need additional configuration since GitHub Pages is designed for static sites. You may need to use HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter or add a 404.html file with a redirect script to handle client-side routing properly[3].
After deployment, your React app will be accessible at https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name[1][3].
