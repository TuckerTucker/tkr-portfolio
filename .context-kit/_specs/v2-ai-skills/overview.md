Looking at these fascinating projects, I can see a clear narrative of someone who's pioneering AI-human collaboration through practical tools and thoughtful design. Let me explore the key themes for 5 slides each:

## Context-Kit Project

**Slide 1: The Problem Space**
- AI agents constantly relearning project structure wastes time
- Repetitive context-setting in every conversation
- No persistent memory between sessions
- Fragmented understanding across different AI tools

**Slide 2: The Solution Architecture**
- Service-oriented design with modular components
- Unified React dashboard aggregating all toolkit functionality
- Knowledge graph backend for relationship mapping
- MCP integration for persistent AI memory

**Slide 3: The Innovation - AGx Design**
- "Agent Experience Design" - designing FOR AI agents as users
- Conducted user research WITH AI agents to understand their needs
- YAML semantic anchors reduce context from 1000 to 300 lines
- Progressive context disclosure matching agent consumption patterns

**Slide 4: Implementation Details**
- 11 specialized Claude Code agents for different tasks
- Parallel agent execution with consolidation patterns
- _project.yml as comprehensive context map
- Auto-updating through commit hooks

**Slide 5: Impact & Learning**
- Agents focus on actual work vs. rediscovering structure
- Semantic consistency across all AI interactions
- Dual interfaces: visual for humans, structured for agents
- Foundation for future history system tracking bugs and solutions

## TaskBoardAI Project

**Slide 1: Personal Pain Point**
- Markdown to-do lists hard to maintain and visualize
- Need for both human visual interaction and AI file manipulation
- Existing tools don't bridge human-AI collaboration gap
- Daily workflow friction managing tasks

**Slide 2: Dual Interface Innovation**
- Humans: drag-and-drop visual kanban interface
- AI agents: JSON file structure they can easily parse
- Same underlying data, different interaction modalities
- File-based architecture serves both users optimally

**Slide 3: Technical Architecture**
- Card-first design for efficient state management
- MCP server eliminates repetitive JSON prompting
- Single attribute change moves cards between columns
- Published npm package with CLI tools

**Slide 4: Real-World Testing**
- Used daily while building other software projects
- Real-time feedback loop with AI agents debugging issues
- Iterative improvements based on actual usage patterns
- Validated through practical application

**Slide 5: Broader Implications**
- Demonstrates how different users need different interfaces
- File operations more natural for AI than database queries
- Context preservation through MCP changes conversation dynamics
- Model for future human-AI collaborative tools

## AI Progress Steps Framework

**Slide 1: The Journey Map**
- Five stages: Chatter → Prompter → Collaborator → Coordinator → Creator
- Each transition involves emotional and skill shifts
- From "AI can do anything!" to "I create through AI"
- Confidence rollercoaster throughout journey

**Slide 2: Early Stage Challenges**
- Chatter: Overconfidence meets first frustration wall
- Prompter: Pride in formulas but still transactional
- Tool overwhelm and context confusion
- "Why won't it give me what I want?"

**Slide 3: Mid-Journey Transitions**
- Collaborator: Loss of control becomes partnership
- Productivity dip while learning new workflows
- Trust issues: "Can I rely on this for real work?"
- Identity crisis: "Am I still a 'real' developer?"

**Slide 4: Advanced Orchestration**
- Coordinator: Managing multiple AI agents
- Decision fatigue about which AI for which task
- Delegation dilemma - fear of disconnection from code
- Complexity overwhelm in orchestration

**Slide 5: Creator Transformation**
- Moving from solving given problems to defining problems
- "I can build my ideas" confidence
- AI becomes part of thinking process
- Ongoing responsibility to help others on journey

## Cross-Project Insights

These projects reveal someone who:
- Practices what they preach about AI-human collaboration
- Solves personal pain points that scale to universal needs
- Understands both technical implementation and human psychology
- Designs systems, not just interfaces
- Conducts genuine research with AI agents as users
- Creates tools that respect different interaction preferences
- Builds with empathy for the entire user journey

The progression from emotional framework (AI Progress) to practical tool (TaskBoard) to system-level solution (Context-Kit) shows deepening understanding of how humans and AI can work together effectively.
