Looking at the current component structure and your slide plans, I can see some excellent opportunities to leverage existing components and identify a few new ones that would be beneficial. Let me break this down:

## How Current Components Map to Your Slide Needs

### Existing Components That Work Well:

1. **ImageCarousel** - Perfect for your project showcases
   - Already supports images, videos, and HTML components
   - Mobile-responsive with vertical scrolling
   - Can display your project screenshots and interactive demos

2. **TechStack** - Ideal for showing your technical skills
   - Grid layout for technologies
   - Supports icons and descriptions
   - Theme-aware for light/dark modes

3. **UserPersona** - Great for demonstrating user research
   - Shows demographics, goals, pain points
   - Mobile-first responsive design
   - Could represent your different user types (event marketers, AI agents)

4. **ProcessTimeline** - Excellent for showing project progression
   - Visual timeline with stages
   - Active state highlighting
   - Perfect for showing your UX process or AI Progress Steps

5. **DesignSystem** - Showcases your design thinking
   - Typography and color palettes
   - Component patterns
   - Interactive tabs

## Suggested New Components for Your Specific Needs:

### 1. **AIInteractionShowcase**
```jsx
// Shows side-by-side human vs AI interaction patterns
// Left: Human drag-drop interface
// Right: AI JSON/YAML view
// Center: Shared data model visualization
```

### 2. **ContextEvolutionSlide**
```jsx
// Animated component showing context reduction
// Before: 1000 lines of YAML
// After: 300 lines with semantic anchors
// Visual diff highlighting efficiency gains
```

### 3. **DualInterfaceDemo**
```jsx
// Interactive demo showing your dual interface concept
// Toggle between "Human View" and "AI View"
// Same data, different presentations
// Live switching to demonstrate the concept
```

### 4. **AgentConversationFlow**
```jsx
// Shows conversational design patterns
// Message bubbles with agent responses
// Highlights context preservation
// Shows MCP integration benefits
```

### 5. **ProjectImpactMetrics**
```jsx
// Quantifiable results from your projects
// Before/after metrics
// Time saved, efficiency gained
// User satisfaction scores
```

## How to Structure Your Slides Using Components:

### Context-Kit Project (5 slides)
1. **ProcessTimeline** - Problem to solution journey
2. **TechStack** - Service architecture visualization  
3. **NEW: AIInteractionShowcase** - AGx Design demonstration
4. **NEW: ContextEvolutionSlide** - YAML optimization
5. **NEW: ProjectImpactMetrics** - Results and learning

### TaskBoardAI Project (5 slides)
1. **UserPersona** - "You" as the frustrated markdown user
2. **NEW: DualInterfaceDemo** - Human vs AI interaction
3. **BeforeAfter** - Markdown lists vs Kanban board
4. **TechStack** - Technical architecture
5. **UsabilityMetrics** - Testing and validation results

### AI Progress Steps (5 slides)
1. **ProcessTimeline** - The 5-stage journey
2. **UserFlow** - Emotional transitions at each stage
3. **SkillsMatrix** - Skills needed at each level
4. **NEW: AgentConversationFlow** - Evolution of prompting
5. **UserPersona** - "Creator" level persona

## Component Enhancements to Consider:

### For ProcessTimeline:
- Add emotion indicators (confidence levels)
- Include branching paths for different journeys
- Add tooltips with detailed stage information

### For TechStack:
- Group by category (Frontend, Backend, AI Tools)
- Add proficiency levels
- Include links to actual implementations

### For UserPersona:
- Add "Tools Used" section
- Include interaction preferences
- Add journey stage indicator

## Implementation Priority:

1. **Start with existing components** - Get immediate value
2. **Create DualInterfaceDemo** - Core to your narrative
3. **Build AIInteractionShowcase** - Demonstrates unique approach
4. **Add ProjectImpactMetrics** - Shows concrete results

The beauty of your current architecture is that these new components can follow the same patterns as your existing HTML slides, making them easy to integrate into your ImageCarousel system. Each new component would be added to the `htmlSlideComponents` registry and wrapped with your theme-aware wrapper.

Would you like me to create any of these new components to demonstrate how they'd work with your current system?
