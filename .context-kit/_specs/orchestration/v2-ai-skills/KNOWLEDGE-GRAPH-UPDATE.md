# Knowledge Graph Integration for V2 AI Skills Orchestration

## 🔧 Updated Agent: kg-portfolio-analyzer

I've created an enhanced version of `kg-initial-analyzer` called `kg-portfolio-analyzer` that **guarantees knowledge graph population**.

### Key Improvements

#### 1. **Mandatory Entity Creation**
The agent now has explicit requirements to create specific entities:

```typescript
// Portfolio Architecture
- Portfolio: TuckerPortfolio
- UIComponent: Existing components (ImageCarousel, ThemeToggle, etc.)
- AISkillsComponent: 5 new components to be built
- AISkillsProject: 3 project showcases
- DesignSystem: Theme and styling architecture
```

#### 2. **Forced Relationship Mapping**
The agent MUST create relationships:
```typescript
- USES: Components using theme system
- INCLUDES: Projects including components
- CONTAINS: Portfolio containing projects
- DEPENDS_ON: Component dependencies
```

#### 3. **Built-in Verification**
Multiple verification steps ensure success:
```bash
# Stats verification (must show populated data)
mcp__tkr-context-kit__get_stats

# Search verification
mcp__tkr-context-kit__search_entities --query="Portfolio"
mcp__tkr-context-kit__search_entities --query="AISkills"

# Relationship verification
mcp__tkr-context-kit__query --sql="SELECT * FROM relations LIMIT 10"
```

#### 4. **Success Criteria**
The agent only succeeds if:
- Entities > 15 (up from current 19)
- Relations > 5 (up from current 0)
- All required entity types created
- Search queries return results

## 🚀 Updated Orchestration Commands

### Wave 1: Knowledge Graph Population

```bash
# Deploy the enhanced kg-portfolio-analyzer
Task(
  subagent_type: "kg-portfolio-analyzer",
  description: "Populate knowledge graph for AI Skills orchestration",
  prompt: "Analyze the portfolio and CREATE entities and relationships in the knowledge graph for:
  1. Existing components and their patterns
  2. Current project structure
  3. Theme and design system architecture
  4. Planned AI Skills components (5 new components)
  5. Target project showcases (3 new projects)

  MANDATORY: You must create entities and relationships, not just analyze.
  Verify final stats show entities > 15 and relations > 5.
  Report the specific entities and relationships created."
)
```

### Verification After Agent Runs

```bash
# Check that entities were created
mcp__tkr-context-kit__get_stats
# Should show significant increase in entities and relations

# Query specific entities
mcp__tkr-context-kit__search_entities --query="AIInteractionShowcase"
mcp__tkr-context-kit__search_entities --query="ContextKitV2"

# Verify relationships exist
mcp__tkr-context-kit__query --sql="
  SELECT
    e1.name as from_entity,
    r.type as relationship,
    e2.name as to_entity
  FROM relations r
  JOIN entities e1 ON r.from_id = e1.id
  JOIN entities e2 ON r.to_id = e2.id
  LIMIT 10
"
```

## 🔍 Integration with Existing Context-Kit

The knowledge graph will now contain:

### Entity Types
```yaml
Portfolio:
  - TuckerPortfolio (main portfolio entity)

UIComponent:
  - ImageCarousel (existing)
  - ThemeToggle (existing)
  - ProcessTimeline (existing)
  - UserPersona (existing)
  - TechStack (existing)
  - BeforeAfter (existing)

AISkillsComponent:
  - AIInteractionShowcase (planned)
  - DualInterfaceDemo (planned)
  - ContextEvolutionSlide (planned)
  - ProjectImpactMetrics (planned)
  - AgentConversationFlow (planned)

AISkillsProject:
  - ContextKitV2 (5 slides)
  - TaskBoardAIV2 (5 slides)
  - AIProgressStepsV2 (5 slides)

DesignSystem:
  - PortfolioTheme (CSS variables, light/dark mode)
```

### Relationship Types
```yaml
USES:
  - AISkillsComponents → PortfolioTheme
  - New projects → existing patterns

INCLUDES:
  - Projects → Components (which components in which slides)

CONTAINS:
  - Portfolio → Projects
  - Projects → Slides

DEPENDS_ON:
  - Components → React/TypeScript
  - New components → existing patterns
```

## 🎯 Benefits for Orchestration

### 1. **Pattern Reuse**
```bash
# Query existing patterns before building
mcp__tkr-context-kit__find_patterns --componentName="ImageCarousel"
# Use results to ensure new components follow same patterns
```

### 2. **Dependency Tracking**
```bash
# Check what depends on theme system
mcp__tkr-context-kit__get_component_dependencies --componentName="PortfolioTheme"
# Ensure all new components integrate properly
```

### 3. **Impact Analysis**
```bash
# Before making changes, check impact
mcp__tkr-context-kit__analyze_impact --entityName="AIInteractionShowcase"
# Understand what would be affected
```

### 4. **Automated Insights**
The knowledge graph will enable:
- Component reuse recommendations
- Integration point identification
- Conflict detection
- Pattern consistency validation

## 🚦 Ready to Deploy

The updated orchestration can now:

1. **Use kg-portfolio-analyzer** instead of kg-initial-analyzer
2. **Guarantee knowledge graph population** with verification
3. **Query patterns and dependencies** for better component design
4. **Track relationships** between all portfolio elements
5. **Validate consistency** throughout the build process

### Deployment Command

```bash
# Deploy enhanced knowledge graph analyzer
"Use kg-portfolio-analyzer to analyze portfolio and populate knowledge graph with entities for existing components, planned AI Skills components, project showcases, and their relationships. Verify entities > 15 and relations > 5."
```

This ensures the knowledge graph becomes a central source of truth for the entire v2 AI Skills orchestration! 🎯
