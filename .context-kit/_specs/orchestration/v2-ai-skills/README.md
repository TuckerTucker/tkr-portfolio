# V2 AI Skills Portfolio - Orchestration Command Center

## 🚀 Quick Start

This orchestration plan enables **12 AI agents** to work in parallel across **5 synchronized waves** to implement Tucker's v2 AI Skills portfolio in approximately **100 minutes** (vs 400+ minutes sequential).

## 📋 Orchestration Overview

| Wave | Agents | Duration | Focus |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| **1** | 3 agents | ~15 min | Foundation & Analysis |
| **2** | 5 agents | ~30 min | Core Component Development |
| **3** | 3 agents | ~20 min | Content Creation |
| **4** | 2 agents | ~15 min | Integration & Demos |
| **5** | 2 agents | ~20 min | Polish & Optimization |

## 🎯 Strategic Approach

### Key Innovations
1. **Territorial Ownership**: Each agent owns exclusive files - zero conflicts
2. **Interface-First Development**: Contracts defined before implementation
3. **Progressive Validation**: Quality gates after each wave
4. **Parallel Execution**: 75% time reduction through smart parallelization

### Success Metrics
- Portfolio loads in < 3 seconds
- Lighthouse scores > 90
- Zero accessibility violations
- Complete Hive.co positioning
- All interactive demos functional

## 🚦 Launch Instructions

### Wave 1: Foundation (Launch Immediately)
```bash
# Launch all three Wave 1 agents in parallel:

# Agent 1-A: Portfolio Auditor
"Analyze the existing portfolio structure and document all patterns, components, and integration points following the prompts in agent-prompts/wave-1-prompts.md"

# Agent 1-B: Data Model Architect
"Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and data models for the AI Skills components following the specifications in agent-prompts/wave-1-prompts.md"

# Agent 1-C: Interface Contract Designer
"Design component communication contracts and integration specifications as detailed in agent-prompts/wave-1-prompts.md"
```

### Wave 2: Components (After Wave 1 Gate)
```bash
# Launch when Wave 1 complete:

# Agent 2-A: AIInteractionShowcase Builder
"Build the AIInteractionShowcase component with dual-interface display and sync indicators using the contracts from Wave 1"

# Agent 2-B: DualInterfaceDemo Builder
"Create the DualInterfaceDemo component with interactive view switching and guided scenarios"

# Agent 2-C: ContextEvolutionSlide Builder
"Implement the ContextEvolutionSlide component for YAML optimization visualization"

# Agent 2-D: ProjectImpactMetrics Builder
"Build the ProjectImpactMetrics component with multiple visualization options"

# Agent 2-E: AgentConversationFlow Builder
"Create the AgentConversationFlow component showing 5-stage conversation evolution"
```

### Wave 3: Content (After Wave 2 Gate)
```bash
# Launch when Wave 2 complete:

# Agent 3-A: Context-Kit Content Creator
"Create the Context-Kit project showcase with 5 slides using Wave 2 components"

# Agent 3-B: TaskBoardAI Content Creator
"Build the TaskBoardAI project showcase featuring the DualInterfaceDemo"

# Agent 3-C: AI Progress Steps Content Creator
"Develop the AI Progress Steps showcase with journey visualization"
```

### Wave 4: Integration (After Wave 3 Gate)
```bash
# Launch when Wave 3 complete:

# Agent 4-A: Portfolio Integration Specialist
"Update main navigation and create Hive.co landing section"

# Agent 4-B: Interactive Demo Engineer
"Build working demos including YAML editor and TaskBoard demo"
```

### Wave 5: Polish (After Wave 4 Gate)
```bash
# Launch when Wave 4 complete:

# Agent 5-A: Responsive & Accessibility Engineer
"Optimize for mobile and ensure full accessibility compliance"

# Agent 5-B: Performance & Analytics Engineer
"Implement lazy loading, code splitting, and analytics tracking"
```

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Check Status
```bash
# Monitor all agents
.context-kit/_specs/orchestration/scripts/monitor.sh watch

# Check specific agent
.context-kit/_specs/orchestration/scripts/monitor.sh agent 2-A

# View blockers
.context-kit/_specs/orchestration/scripts/monitor.sh blockers
```

### Validation Gates
Each wave must pass validation before the next begins:
- Wave 1: Foundation contracts complete
- Wave 2: All components render
- Wave 3: Content sequences navigable
- Wave 4: Integration successful
- Wave 5: Performance targets met

## 🎯 Implementation Goals

### Technical Excellence
- **Performance**: < 3s load time, > 90 Lighthouse
- **Quality**: 100% TypeScript, > 80% test coverage
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first, all breakpoints

### Business Impact
- **Positioning**: Clear AI-human collaboration expertise
- **Differentiation**: "User research WITH AI agents"
- **Credibility**: Working demos and metrics
- **Targeting**: Hive.co-specific messaging

## ⚡ Critical Success Factors

1. **Strict Territorial Boundaries**: No file conflicts
2. **Contract Compliance**: All interfaces honored
3. **Progressive Validation**: Gates prevent cascades
4. **Parallel Execution**: Maximize concurrency
5. **Clear Communication**: Status updates every 5 min

## 🚨 Failure Recovery

If any agent fails:
1. Other agents in wave continue
2. Failed agent documents blockers
3. Recovery agent deployed if critical
4. Wave gate holds until resolved
5. Maximum 15 min recovery window

## ✅ Final Deliverables

Upon completion, Tucker's portfolio will feature:
- ✨ 3 AI-focused project showcases
- 🎯 Hive.co-specific landing section
- 🔧 5 new interactive components
- 📊 Working demos with live data
- 📱 Full mobile responsiveness
- ♿ Complete accessibility
- 📈 Analytics tracking
- 🚀 Production-ready deployment
