## Key Themes Throughout

### 1. User Research is Universal
Whether users are human or AI, understanding their mental models and interaction patterns is fundamental.

### 2. Collaboration Over Control
Design for partnership between humans and AI, not replacement or dominance.

### 3. Interface Optimization Beats Universal Interfaces
Let different users work in their natural patterns while sharing underlying data.

### 4. Iteration With Real Feedback
Whether feedback comes from usability tests or agent conversations, iteration based on actual use is essential.

### 5. Process Reveals Thinking
Show the work - sketches, decisions, iterations - not just polished outputs.
