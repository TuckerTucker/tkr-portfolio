# About Tucker

## I solve big problems in small ways—creating software people love to use.

My background in stakeholder interviews and usability testing taught me how to uncover user mental models and ask the right design questions. I've learned that the key to designing intuitive interfaces is understanding not just what users want to accomplish, but how they think about the problem space.

For three and a half years, I produced *The Spark & The Art* podcast, interviewing photographers, novelists, filmmakers, and songwriters about their creative process. This taught me how to listen deeply, ask clarifying questions, and draw out insights that people don't initially articulate—skills that directly translate to user research and stakeholder collaboration.

Through my *Off-Hours Creative* course, I've developed methods for breaking down complex concepts into digestible chunks. My approach treats design problems like songwriting: distill the concept to its essence, craft a narrative structure, and iterate until every element serves the whole. This skill for conceptual distillation shapes how I communicate designs to stakeholders and document systems for both human and AI users.

Recently, I've been exploring how these UX principles apply to a new kind of user: AI agents. Through my work on tkr-context-kit and TaskBoardAI, I've been conducting "user research" with AI agents—asking them what context formats work best, iterating based on their feedback, and designing systems where humans and AI collaborate through different interfaces on the same data.

Whether I'm designing for humans or AI agents, my approach stays the same: understand the mental model, design for the interaction patterns that feel natural, and iterate based on real feedback.

## How I Work

My design process follows a framework I call **USCV: Understand, Solve, Create, Verify.**

**Understand** - I immerse myself in stakeholder conversations and user research before touching design tools. At Vidflex, I interviewed everyone from the CEO to customer support, turning findings into user avatars and process flows that guided the entire product roadmap.

**Solve** - I explore multiple approaches before committing to one direction, collaborating with developers early to understand constraints and opportunities.

**Create** - I build high-fidelity prototypes that feel real enough to test, designing for the complete experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

**Verify** - I test early and often, watching where users struggle and adjusting based on real behavior, not assumptions.

This framework keeps me focused on solving the right problems before building solutions—whether those solutions are for human users navigating a video platform or AI agents processing project context.
