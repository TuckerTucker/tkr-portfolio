# Context Kit Section Implementation Plan

**Date:** 2025-01-30
**Status:** Ready for Implementation
**Decision:** Replace existing projects with 5 new sections, starting with Context Kit

---

## Overview

This plan details the implementation of the Context Kit section for Tucker's portfolio, demonstrating Agent Experience (AGx) Design through an 8-slide narrative.

**Key Decision:** Option B - Chat-style message bubbles for Slide 4 (User Research with AI Agents)

---

## Section Structure: 8 Slides

### **Slide 1: Project Introduction**
**Component:** `ProjectIntro`
**Purpose:** Hook with problem statement + AGx concept introduction

**Content:**
- **Title:** "Context Kit: Designing for AI Agent Experience (AGx)"
- **Description:**
  - Problem: Agents wasted 26+ seconds re-exploring project structure every conversation
  - Core insight: AI agents process information differently than humans
  - Solution: AGx Design treats AI agents as users with their own interaction needs
- **Bullets:**
  - "Agents re-explored project structure every conversation (26+ seconds wasted)"
  - "AGx Design: applying UX principles to AI agent experience"
  - "Result: 75% token reduction, 90% time reduction through user research WITH agents"
- **Image:** Dashboard screenshot or conversation comparison visual
- **Color Scheme:** `contextkit` (#8B5CF6 purple)

**Status:** ✅ Component exists, needs data only

---

### **Slide 2: AGx Design Philosophy**
**Component:** `InteractiveCards` (3 cards)
**Purpose:** Explain what AGx Design is and why it matters

**Card 1: "AGx Concept"**
- **Icon:** Brain
- **Label:** "What is AGx?"
- **Content:** "AGx (Agent Experience) Design applies UX principles to AI agent experience. Just as UX designers conduct user research with humans to understand mental models, I conduct user research WITH AI agents to understand what context formats work best for them."
- **Image:** AI agent interacting with structured data
- **Position:** Left

**Card 2: "User Research Method"**
- **Icon:** Microscope
- **Label:** "Research Process"
- **Content:** "I ask agents directly: 'What context helps you understand this better?' 'What's missing?' 'What's redundant?' Through iterative conversations, agents told me YAML semantic anchors reduce repetition, hierarchical structure mirrors their processing, and progressive disclosure lets them scan efficiently."
- **Image:** Conversation between human and AI with feedback loops
- **Position:** Right

**Card 3: "Core Principles"**
- **Icon:** Target
- **Label:** "AGx Principles"
- **Content:** "1. Understand agent cognition - how do AI agents process information? 2. Design for token efficiency - eliminate repetitive exploration. 3. Enable progressive disclosure - agents scan overview, drill down as needed. 4. Maintain human accessibility - humans must read and maintain the system."
- **Image:** Design principles diagram
- **Position:** Left

**Status:** ✅ Component exists, needs data configuration

---

### **Slide 3: YAML Optimization Journey**
**Component:** `YAMLContextViewer` (existing interactive component)
**Purpose:** Show technical solution - 1000 lines → 300 lines evolution

**Content:**
- Before/after YAML comparison
- Semantic anchor examples (`&tech-stack` / `*tech-stack`)
- Token efficiency metrics (75% reduction)
- Interactive exploration of YAML structure

**Props:** (Component already configured)

**Status:** ✅ Component exists and is perfect as-is

---

### **Slide 4: User Research with AI Agents** ⭐ NEW APPROACH
**Component:** NEW `ConversationExamples` OR adapt `AgentConversationFlow`
**Purpose:** Show actual agent research conversations with chat-style message bubbles

**Format:** Chat message bubbles (human/agent conversation flow)

**Research Session 1: Format Selection**
```
👤 Tucker: "Would JSON be better than YAML for the context file?"

🤖 Claude: "YAML has advantages for context files. The semantic anchors
(`&anchor` and `*reference`) let me see relationships without reading
the same content multiple times. JSON would require full duplication
or complex referencing. The hierarchical indentation also helps me
quickly scan structure levels."

💡 Design Decision: Stuck with YAML + added inline comments explaining
architectural decisions since agents told me this helped them understand
*why* not just *what*
```

**Research Session 2: Progressive Disclosure**
```
👤 Tucker: "Do you use all the detail in the services section every time?"

🤖 Claude: "No. Usually I scan the meta and struct sections first to
build a mental model. I only dive into detailed service specs when
working on that specific service. The two-tier structure (overview + detail)
is efficient."

💡 Design Decision: Restructured to have lightweight references at top
level, detailed specs in dedicated sections. Agents can now scan
efficiently and drill down only when needed.
```

**Research Session 3: Token Optimization**
```
👤 Tucker: "Should we use box-drawing characters (├──, │, └──) for
directory trees? They look nice."

🤖 Claude: "Box characters consume extra tokens without adding semantic
value. Simple indentation provides the same structural information with
minimal overhead. Token efficiency matters more than visual aesthetics."

💡 Design Decision: NEVER use box characters. Simple indentation only.
Token bloat reduction > visual appeal when agents are primary users.
```

**Visual Design:**
- Chat bubbles with different colors (human = blue, agent = purple, decision = green)
- Avatar icons for each participant type
- Smooth reveal animation (one exchange at a time)
- Decision callouts highlighted with lightbulb icon

**Status:** 🆕 NEW COMPONENT NEEDED - Chat-style conversation display

**Reference Document:** `/Volumes/tkr-riffic/@tkr-projects/tkr-portfolio/.context-kit/_specs/tucker-portfolio-content/yaml_research_conversation.md`

---

### **Slide 5: Service Architecture**
**Component:** `InteractiveCards` (4 cards - one per service)
**Purpose:** Explain service-oriented design enabling modularity

**Card 1: React Dashboard (Port 42001)**
- **Icon:** Layout (or Monitor)
- **Label:** "Visual Interface"
- **Content:** "Unified React dashboard aggregating all toolkit functionality. Provides real-time service health monitoring, log viewing, and performance metrics. Human-optimized interface with visual feedback."
- **Image:** Dashboard screenshot
- **Position:** Left

**Card 2: Knowledge Graph API (Port 42003)**
- **Icon:** Database
- **Label:** "Data Backend"
- **Content:** "SQLite + FTS5 storage enabling agents to query component relationships without file traversal. HTTP API provides structured access to entities, relationships, and project knowledge graph."
- **Image:** API architecture diagram
- **Position:** Right

**Card 3: Logging Service**
- **Icon:** FileText (or ScrollText)
- **Label:** "Debug Intelligence"
- **Content:** "Centralized logging service with structured output for debugging. Agents can reference logs to understand system behavior, trace execution paths, and identify issues without manual exploration."
- **Image:** Log viewer interface
- **Position:** Left

**Card 4: MCP Integration**
- **Icon:** Zap (or Network)
- **Label:** "Persistent Memory"
- **Content:** "Model Context Protocol server providing persistent AI memory across conversations. Context automatically loaded every conversation - no more re-exploration of project structure. Zero overhead context awareness."
- **Image:** MCP connection diagram
- **Position:** Right

**Status:** ✅ Component exists, needs data configuration

---

### **Slide 6: Parallel Agent Orchestration**
**Component:** `ParallelAgentsDemo` (existing interactive component)
**Purpose:** Show agent coordination with context-init workflow

**Content:**
- 3 parallel agents visualization:
  1. Component Analyzer - Updates knowledge graph
  2. Documentation Agent - Refreshes docs
  3. Structure Agent - Maintains YAML
- Consolidation Agent workflow
- Time savings: 8-10 minutes → 2-3 minutes
- Real-time execution simulation

**Props:** (Component already configured)

**Status:** ✅ Component exists and is perfect as-is

---

### **Slide 7: Before/After Impact**
**Component:** `BeforeAfter`
**Purpose:** Demonstrate conversation efficiency transformation

**Before State:**
- **Title:** "Without Context Kit"
- **Description:** "Agent exploration overhead every conversation"
- **Image:** Frustrated developer watching loading spinner
- **Characteristics:**
  - "Search for component files (8 seconds)"
  - "Read existing documentation (12 seconds)"
  - "Map project structure (6 seconds)"
  - "Finally answer the question"
  - "~3,200 tokens consumed in exploration"
- **Pain Points:**
