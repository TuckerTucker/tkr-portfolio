### State Management
- Local state for interactive elements
- Optional controlled component patterns
- Preserve state during view transitions
- Support for external state management if needed

### Performance Considerations
- Use existing `cn` utility for className merging
- Leverage `useTheme` hook for theme detection
- Implement suspense boundaries for heavy visualizations
- Consider lazy loading for animation libraries
- Maintain consistent prop patterns with existing components

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Component Complexity**: Start with simpler components, build complexity gradually
- **Performance**: Implement performance optimizations systematically
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test early and often across target browsers

### Content Risks
- **Message Clarity**: Test narrative flow with stakeholders
- **Technical Validation**: Ensure all demos work reliably
- **Mobile Experience**: Prioritize mobile-first design throughout

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined component specifications
- **Perfect Polish**: Focus on core functionality first, polish second
- **Integration Issues**: Test component integration continuously

## Definition of Done

Each task is complete when:
1. **Functionality**: Component works as specified across all target devices
2. **Quality**: Passes accessibility, performance, and browser compatibility tests
3. **Integration**: Successfully integrates with existing portfolio architecture
4. **Documentation**: Component props and usage are documented
5. **Testing**: Manual testing completed and edge cases handled
6. **Review**: Code reviewed for maintainability and best practices

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Task 1 (Portfolio Audit) to establish baseline
2. Create detailed component specifications based on existing patterns
3. Set up development environment with proper testing tools
4. Establish review checkpoints after Foundation and Core Component phases
5. Plan user testing sessions for content validation before final polish

This plan prioritizes getting working demonstrations quickly while building a solid foundation for long-term maintainability and effectiveness in achieving the primary goal: landing the Hive.co Senior AI UX Designer position.
