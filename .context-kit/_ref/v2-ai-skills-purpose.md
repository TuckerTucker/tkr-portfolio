# Project Purpose & Goal Context for AI Agents

## Project Identity

### What This Is
**Tucker's Portfolio Website** - A React-based interactive portfolio showcasing Sean "Tucker" Harley's journey from traditional UX design to pioneering AI-human collaboration patterns, specifically positioned for the **Hive.co Senior AI UX Designer role**.

### The Core Narrative
This portfolio tells the story of a UX designer who discovered that designing FOR AI agents is as important as designing WITH them. It demonstrates practical experience in creating dual-interface systems where humans and AI agents collaborate through their preferred interaction modalities.

- Demonstrate technical competency alongside design skills
- Present a portfolio that itself uses AI-first development practices

## Key Differentiators

## Technical Context for AI Agents Working on This

### Development Philosophy
- **Component-First**: Every slide is a reusable, testable component
- **Story-Driven**: Using Storybook for component development
- **Theme-Aware**: Respects user preferences with full dark/light mode support
- **Performance-Focused**: Lazy loading, code splitting, optimized assets
- **Accessible**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader friendly

### Architecture Decisions
- **Why React + Vite**: Fast development, modern tooling, industry standard
- **Why Custom Components**: Full control over AI-human interaction demonstrations
- **Why HTML Slides**: Flexibility to create interactive demonstrations
- **Why File-Based**: Easier for AI agents to understand and modify

## Project Constraints & Considerations

### Must-Haves
- Mobile responsive (hiring manager might view on phone)
- Fast load time (first impression crucial)
- Clear navigation (don't make them hunt for information)
- Working demonstrations (not just mockups)
- Professional but personable tone

### Nice-to-Haves
- Interactive AI agent conversations
- Live data visualization
- Downloadable case studies
- Video demonstrations

### Avoid
- Generic portfolio templates
- Too much technical jargon without context
- Walls of text without visual breaks
- Claims without evidence
- Forgetting the human element while focusing on AI

## The Meta Layer
