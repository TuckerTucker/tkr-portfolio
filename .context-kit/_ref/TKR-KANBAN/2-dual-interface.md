## 2) Dual Interface

**a. MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
The MCP server provides automatic context to AI agents, eliminating the need to include JSON examples in every prompt. This creates natural conversations where agents can immediately understand and interact with the kanban structure without requiring database management skills or repeated context establishment.

**b. JSON Data Source**
File-based architecture serves as the single source of truth that both interfaces can access. AI agents leverage their existing file editing capabilities to modify tasks directly, while the JSON structure remains human-readable for transparency. The card-first design enables efficient updates - moving a card between columns requires only a single attribute change rather than restructuring the entire board.

**c. Web UI**
Responsive drag-and-drop interface that provides humans with the visual, tactile experience they expect from kanban boards. Real-time updates reflect changes made by either human users or AI agents, creating seamless collaboration where both parties can see the results of each other's work immediately.

This dual interface approach demonstrates your core insight about designing for multiple user types simultaneously - a key principle for AI UX design where humans need to maintain oversight and control while AI agents handle execution and analysis tasks.
