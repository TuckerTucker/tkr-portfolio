1. For People and Agents
a. Next Steps is Goal
The next-steps array serves as high-level project guidance that both humans and AI agents can reference for strategic direction. Humans see it as actionable project priorities, while AI agents use it to understand project context and suggest relevant task breakdowns or optimizations.
b. Subtasks
Checkable task breakdown with âœ“ completion markers provides granular progress tracking. Humans get satisfying visual feedback from checking off completed items, while AI agents can parse completion status to suggest next actions, identify blockers, or automatically update project status.
c. Dependency Mapping
The dependencies array creates clear task relationships that both user types can leverage. Humans understand prerequisite work visually, while AI agents can analyze dependency chains to suggest optimal task sequencing, identify critical path issues, or automatically move dependent tasks when blockers are resolved.
d. Card-First Architecture
Each card is self-contained with its own columnId reference, making single-card operations efficient for both interfaces. Humans experience responsive drag-and-drop (one attribute change vs. array restructuring), while AI agents can easily modify individual cards without parsing entire board structures - enabling natural language commands like "move feature-two to done" without complex data manipulation.
