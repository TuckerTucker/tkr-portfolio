1) Problem to be solved
a. Pain Point
Managing tasks through markdown files was challenging to maintain and update effectively. Traditional kanban tools forced either human-friendly interfaces OR AI-friendly data structures, but not both simultaneously.
b. Insight
AI agents and humans have fundamentally different interaction preferences - humans prefer visual drag-and-drop interfaces while AI agents work best with structured file operations. The breakthrough was realizing we could serve both users with the same underlying data through different interface modalities.
c. Goal
Create a dual-interface kanban system where humans enjoy intuitive visual interactions while AI agents efficiently parse and modify the same task data through their preferred file-based operations - enabling true human-AI collaborative task management.
