# Logging Integration Implementation Tasks

## Goal
Enable automatic, transparent log capture from browser console and terminal commands with minimal configuration, preserving developer workflows while providing comprehensive logging coverage.

## Ordered Implementation Tasks

### Foundation - Enhance Current Logging Client
1. Add smart process detection to `auto-init.js` to identify npm/yarn/node process types
2. Implement log batching with configurable buffer size and flush intervals
3. Add filtering logic to skip node_modules and build tool internal messages
4. Create environment variable support for TKR_LOG_LEVEL, TKR_LOG_ENDPOINT configuration
5. Build metadata enrichment for process.cwd(), package.json detection, and session IDs

### Terminal Logging - Shell Integration
6. Create `.context-kit/shell/tkr-logging.sh` with project-aware activation logic
7. Implement command wrapper functions for npm, yarn, git with output passthrough
8. Add log batching and async sending to avoid blocking terminal operations
9. Build installation script with shell detection (bash/zsh) and RC file modification
10. Create uninstallation script with clean marker-based removal from RC files
11. Add prompt indicator function to show when logging is active
12. Test PIPESTATUS preservation for proper exit code handling

### Browser Logging - Client Script
13. Create browser logging client with console method preservation using Proxy pattern
14. Implement passthrough to maintain exact DevTools experience
15. Add session ID generation and tracking for log correlation
16. Build async batch sending with performance monitoring
17. Add window.onerror and unhandledrejection capture
18. Create fallback for offline scenarios with local storage queue

### Browser Integration - Vite Plugin
19. Create `.context-kit/plugins/vite-plugin-tkr-logging.js`
20. Implement transformIndexHtml to inject logging script in development only
21. Add middleware to serve logging client from knowledge-graph service
22. Build auto-detection logic for vite.config.js/ts files
23. Create plugin installation helper for setup script

### Browser Integration - Webpack Plugin
24. Create `.context-kit/plugins/webpack-plugin-tkr-logging.js`
25. Implement HtmlWebpackPlugin hooks for script injection
26. Add webpack-dev-server middleware for client serving
27. Build auto-detection for webpack.config.js files
28. Create plugin installation helper for setup script

### Knowledge-Graph Service Enhancements
29. Add `/api/logging-client.js` endpoint to serve browser client
30. Implement CORS headers for cross-origin script loading
31. Add log batching endpoint to handle bulk log submissions
32. Create rate limiting for log endpoints to prevent abuse
33. Build log deduplication logic for repeated messages

### NODE_OPTIONS Integration
34. Create `.context-kit/env` file with NODE_OPTIONS export
35. Add NODE_OPTIONS setup to main installation script
36. Build process detection to handle different Node.js contexts
37. Implement child process handling to cascade logging
38. Add filtering for npm lifecycle scripts and internal commands

### Setup Script Integration
39. Add terminal logging prompt to main setup script
40. Implement browser plugin detection and configuration suggestions
41. Create NODE_OPTIONS installation with user consent
42. Add verification step to confirm logging is working
43. Build rollback mechanism for failed installations

### Testing & Validation
44. Test terminal logging with various shell commands and pipes
45. Validate browser logging preserves console features and stack traces
46. Verify NODE_OPTIONS doesn't interfere with existing tools
47. Test performance impact stays under 1ms per log
48. Validate project-aware activation works correctly
49. Test installation/uninstallation scripts on different systems
50. Verify log batching and network failure handling

### Documentation & Polish
51. Create user guide for terminal logging features
52. Document browser integration options and setup
53. Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
54. Create examples of filtering and configuration
55. Build performance tuning recommendations
56. Add security considerations documentation

## Implementation Notes

### Task Dependencies
- Tasks 1-5 must complete before NODE_OPTIONS integration (34-38)
- Terminal logging (6-12) can proceed independently
- Browser client (13-18) must complete before Vite/Webpack plugins (19-28)
- Knowledge-graph enhancements (29-33) should complete before browser integration
- Setup script integration (39-43) requires all other components
- Testing (44-50) can begin as each component completes
- Documentation (51-56) should be written alongside implementation

### Priority Order Rationale
1. **Foundation first** - Everything depends on enhanced logging client
2. **Terminal logging second** - Lowest risk, immediate value, good testing ground
3. **Browser client third** - Core functionality before integrations
4. **Build tool plugins fourth** - Depends on browser client
5. **Service enhancements fifth** - Support infrastructure
6. **NODE_OPTIONS sixth** - Most invasive, do after proving concept
7. **Setup integration seventh** - Ties everything together
8. **Testing throughout** - Continuous validation
9. **Documentation last** - Based on final implementation

### Success Criteria
- Zero configuration required for basic usage
- Developer workflows remain unchanged
- All console/terminal output appears normally
- Logs successfully reach dashboard
- Performance overhead < 1% CPU
- Clean uninstall leaves no traces

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with terminal logging (lowest risk, highest control)
- Test each integration layer independently
- Provide clear opt-out mechanisms
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Monitor performance metrics closely

### Quick Wins (Can implement immediately)
- Tasks 1-5: Enhance current logging client (2-3 hours)
- Tasks 6-8: Basic terminal logging script (2-3 hours)
- Task 13-14: Basic browser client with passthrough (1-2 hours)

### Complex Tasks (Need careful planning)
- Task 37: Child process handling in NODE_OPTIONS
- Task 33: Log deduplication algorithm
- Task 18: Offline queue with local storage
- Task 32: Rate limiting implementation

### Testing Checkpoints
- After task 12: Terminal logging fully functional
- After task 18: Browser logging fully functional
- After task 28: Build tool integration complete
- After task 38: NODE_OPTIONS working
- After task 43: Full system integrated
- After task 50: Production ready
