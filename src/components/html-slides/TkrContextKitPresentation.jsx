  const descriptionText = `tkr-context-kit represents pioneering work in Agent Experience (AGx) Design - essentially UX design for AI agents. By conducting user research with AI agents themselves and designing information architecture for their consumption patterns, this project demonstrates how we can create systems that optimize human-AI collaboration.

The breakthrough insight was treating AI agents as primary users with their own needs, preferences, and cognitive patterns. This led to designing semantic architectures, progressive context disclosure, and conversational memory systems that make every interaction more effective.`;
