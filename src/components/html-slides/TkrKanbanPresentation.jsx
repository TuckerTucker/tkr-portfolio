The challenge is that AI can understand an entire markdown document by simply by holding it in context. A person, on the other hand, needs to read the entire document to get the same level of understanding. AI can make multiple edits the document simultaneously. While a person need to edit the document word by word.  So, what if there was a way for a Person and an AI to get the same information in a format better designed for their needs? "

By understanding each user type's natural interaction patterns and designing for their strengths, we can create systems that feel intuitive to both humans and AI.

The key insight was recognizing that successful AI interaction design isn't about making AI work like humans, but about creating complementary interfaces that leverage each user's optimal interaction modality while maintaining shared access to the same underlying data.`;
