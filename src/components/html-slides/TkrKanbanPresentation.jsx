AI agents leverage their existing file editing capabilities to modify tasks directly, while the JSON structure remains human-readable for transparency. The card-first design enables efficient updates - moving a card between columns requires only a single attribute change rather than restructuring the entire board."

By understanding each user type's natural interaction patterns and designing for their strengths, we can create systems that feel intuitive to both humans and AI.

The key insight was recognizing that successful AI interaction design isn't about making AI work like humans, but about creating complementary interfaces that leverage each user's optimal interaction modality while maintaining shared access to the same underlying data.`;
