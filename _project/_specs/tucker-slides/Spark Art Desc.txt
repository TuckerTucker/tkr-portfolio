# Born To The World

I've been a songwriter since I was 17 and when I turned 40, in 2011, I released my first collection of studio recordings. 

Born to the World is 5 songs of Love Soaked Heartache & Wanderlust (plus a lullaby).
You'll learn the answer to the question *Why They Call it a Crush* (because "that's what happened to me when I saw him with you") and you'll be transported to a dreamland in the lullaby 'The Blanket Show'.

These interviews help build the foundation of my understanding of the creative process leading me to start The Off-Hours Creative (more info on the next slide)




# The Off-Hours Creative

Doing creative work outside of a day job helped keep me sane and fulfilled. I wanted to share that with other people with full-time jobs who had creative aspirations "I'd love to learn and instrument", "I have this idea for a book" etc ...

The founding group, in 2019, was 15 people from various creative interests. 

Successes include: 
- A writer who finished the first draft of their novel
- A songwriter that completed the first draft of their musical 
- A paralegal who started their first regular painting practice

Not to make excuses but the pandemic had a negative impact on the group and it wrapped up in 2022
