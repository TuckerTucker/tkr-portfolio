```javascript
'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS',
'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, Authorization',
```

**Risk:** Allows any origin to make requests, potentially enabling CSRF attacks if the server is used in production.

**Remediation:**
```javascript
// Replace with specific origins
'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' 
  ? 'http://localhost:3000' 
  : 'https://tuckertucker.github.io',
```

### H2: Path Traversal Vulnerability in File Server
**Severity:** High | **OWASP:** A01:2021 - Broken Access Control
